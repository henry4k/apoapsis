Apoapsis
========

A game about the solitude and survival in a high-tech lump 20 million meters 
above the earth.

The project is still very WIP!

This repository contains the engine and the core package.
... which is pretty useless for itself.  Take a look at the example package
at https://github.com/henry4k/apoapsis-example to see how it can be used.


## Dependencies

Needed to compile the engine:
- Lua 5.2
- Open GL
- GLEW
- GLFW 3
- libPNG
- Open AL
- ALURE
- Bullet

Ideally install pkg-config and use one of the provided sample
tup.config files.
